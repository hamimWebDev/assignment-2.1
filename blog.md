<!-- Question -->

The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

<!-- Answer -->

Union type allows the variable to select more than one type. For example, you can use number and stream type in the same variable. Since using union on a variable can use any type, code dependency increases. Because as a result, you can guess the type of variable without knowing it and reduce the possibility of error.

An intersection type combines two types, thereby increasing the efficiency of variables using intersection tight, because in many cases where properties of two variables are needed in one variable, using intersection eliminates the need to declare a new type. . This increases the speed of coding.

How to handle asynchronous operations using async/await over callback/promise TypeScript.

<!-- Answer -->

Async/Await is a syntax in TypeScript that helps write promise-based code. It provides convenience with asynchronous functions, i.e. not having to wait for other parts of the program. Asynchronous operations can be waited for by using await within asynchronous functions.
Error handling is easy in asynchronous functions. Errors can be caught using try/catch blocks.

Why are Type Guards Necessary? Discuss Various Types of Type Guards and Their Use Cases.

<!-- Answer -->

Data type safety is an important issue in programming language development. In any programming language, proper use of data types ensures code safety and stability. TypeScript is a popular and well-supported programming language that supports JavaScript's advanced and secure stable data typing. Type Guards are an important feature in TypeScript, which help programmers in data type safety and usage.
A type guard is a statement or function that checks a particular data type to ensure that the value is the correct type. Code is profiled and errors or bugs are prevented using type guards.
Using type guards can clean up code and help developers with data type safety and usage. It helps to improve application performance and security.
Therefore, type guard is an important feature, which makes it easy for the programmer to check different types of data and improves the display system and performance.
